# ml-in-production-getting-started


![alt text](./docs/into.jpg)

Welcome to my project to create a multi-agent system that can do some asynchronous reachout and networking on like minded redditors. This is an purely not for profit project that is meant to showcase skillsets in and around MLOPs, CI/CD, multi-agent systems and other key technologies.

I will be following the course as outlined [here](https://edu.kyrylai.com/courses/ml-in-production)

Note that my main design documents are shared in the module 1 folder for now. I'll update this markdown file to include a summary as time progresses!
