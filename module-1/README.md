# Module 1: Design Document

Throughout this project I will be iterating on a reddit networking bot project as published in a repo [here](https://github.com/abemdxb/reddit-network-bot).

The design document tracked below is a live document and shows what I'm building. However the rest of repo here is going to go across the practice exercises with links to the right PRs in the main project above on the MD files.
