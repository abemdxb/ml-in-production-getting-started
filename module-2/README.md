# Module 2 Practice: Infrastructure


Here I did a couple of practice pieces of work.

1. I went through the docker introduction [tutorials](https://docker-curriculum.com/) and the GitHub Actions tutorials where I went all the way to multicontainer environments.
    a. **Open Questions include:**
       - Can Cline and/or other tools help us create CI/CD pipelines? Or are there standard templates for Actions a good Multi-Agent system? I am worried about time spent here
3. I went through the Kubernetes Basics course,  Hellp MiniKube course and Kind QuickStart
    a. **Open Questions include:**
       - 
5. I also did the practice PRs for the course:
    a. Write a dummy Dockerfile with a simple server and push it to your Docker Hub or GitHub Docker Registr
    b. Write a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions that does this for each PR.
    c. Write YAML definitions for Pod, Deployment, Service, and Job with your Docker image. Use Minikube/Kind for testing it.
