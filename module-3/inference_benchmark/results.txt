## Analysis: CPU Impact on Results

Your CPU characteristics (8 physical cores, 16 logical cores) significantly influence these results:

1. **Process vs. Core Allocation**: While we used 4 processes, how they're scheduled across physical and logical cores affects performance.

2. **CPU Cache Utilization**: Single-process execution makes more efficient use of CPU caches. With multiple processes, each needs its own cache space, potentially causing more cache misses.

3. **Memory Bandwidth Competition**: Multiple processes compete for memory bandwidth, which can become a bottleneck.

4. **Process Scheduling Overhead**: Windows' process scheduler introduces overhead when managing multiple processes.

5. **Data Transfer Costs**: The overhead of serializing/deserializing data between processes can be significant.

Different CPU architectures (like server-grade CPUs with more cores, larger caches, or higher memory bandwidth) would likely show different performance characteristics with the same benchmark code.

## Conclusion

This benchmark demonstrates how to measure and compare inference performance between single and multiple processes. While our specific test case with your CPU didn't show a speedup with multiple processes (speedup < 1.0), the code provides a framework for testing different models and workloads.

The benchmark can be easily modified to test different models, dataset sizes, and process configurations to find the optimal setup for specific machine learning inference tasks on your hardware.
